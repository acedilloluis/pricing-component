## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The biggest hurdle I encountered was styling the input range element. The progress bar like style was only implemented for Firefox since I couldn't find a suitable solution for the webkit browsers. Apart from this hurdle, the next biggest obstacle was styling the toggle switch. Each of these challenges required tedious CSS code.

### Continued development

In the future I'd like to use some type of framework or preprocessor to make the implementation and styling of these elements more streamlined.
